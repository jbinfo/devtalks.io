roboticist. She spent eight years working with robots of various shapes, sizes, and intelligence levels - her specialty was in planning and navigation algorithms (useful for driverless cars, rescue robots, etc.). Eager for some fresh air away from the lab, she switched gears and started developing a better Internet with JavaScript and Node.js.\n\nIn her time away, however, her little robot friends have also learned JavaScript! The likes of Johnny-Five and NodeCopter have breathed new life into those traditionally Python/C++-controlled machines, and our favorite roboticist's little vacation has come to a close.\n\nWhereas 2012 was the start of moving, reactive robots programmed in JavaScript, 2013 will be the year of the smarter, autonomous robot! Task-driven and data-oriented, they will be the most intelligent JS robots you've ever seen - and they'll be the founders of the robot.js of tomorrow.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss and review examples of not only what is possible, but also what traditional roboticists will have a hard time acknowledging: JavaScript is not only a legitimately viable language for robots, but also a fascinating opportunity to solve problems that can't be solved with Python/C++ alone!\n","youtube_id":"NG31UChnNfc"},{"title":"BPM Detection with JavaScript","url":"/talks/jsconf-us/2013/bpm-detection-with-javascript.html","date":"2013-05-28 01:00:00 +0100","categories":["talks","jsconf-us","2013"],"body":"","description":"Digital Signals Processing (DSP) is inherently essential to any signals-based field, be it digital audio effects, computer graphics, or computer vision. The web has just begun it's foray into accommodating for DSP, becoming increasingly equipped to handle and modulate signals with the advent of technologies such as the Web Audio API and WebGL. With the basic DSP tools provided by these technologies, we are minimally bootstrapped and able to leverage these tools to implement powerful algorithms and incorporate powerful fields of research. One such application is the modulation and processing of music signals. In this talk I will focus on an application that is more complicated than it seems: automatic BPM detection of music. Due to the complexities of how we as humans perceive sound, parse harmonics, and \"feel\" beats within a song, BPM becomes a challenging and enthralling problem to tackle. I've just begun to embark on an endeavor to implement BPM detection in javascript, building upon budding DSP tools in JS and pulling from algorithms hardened by academic research. I have been digging into academic research papers in the field identifying and categorizing plausible algorithms from simple to complex, separated by effectiveness for differing applications. I hope to implement a number of these algorithms across this spectrum and compare their effectiveness for different kinds of music and applications. I believe exposing and providing robust algorithms for BPM detection would be a strong tool and asset towards many javascript-based web (and server-side ;D) applications, whether for categorization purposes, or for something more dynamic like music visualization.\n\nI first began my investigation into BPM detection as a way to break music visualization out of its frequency rut to reflect more compelling metrics such as BPM & key, which encode our consumption and perception of music in a different way. I plan to use my implementations to build out music visualizations that use alternative metrics in a compelling way that reflects (or invokes!) how we emotionally react to the music we listen to.\n","youtube_id":"XAqSLcNI9Ac"},{"title":"CreativeJS - making art in the browser","url":"/talks/jsconf-us/2013/creativejs-making-art-in-the-browser.html","date":"2013-05-28 01:00:00 +0100","categories":["talks","jsconf-us","2013"],"body":"","description":"Seb is known for his engaging presentations and this will be no exception.

It turns out JavaScript's highly expressive nature and the infinite posibilities of its syntax made it a favored medium for our literary forebears.\n\nLast summer I introduced the concept of Literary JavaScript with <a href=\"http://byfat.xxx/if-hemingway-wrote-javascript\" target=\"_blank\">If Hemingway wrote JavaScript</a>, wherein five famous writers demonstrated their JavaScript smarts. That article generated very positive reactions from both the JavaScript and Literary communities (including write-ups in the New Yorker, Huffington Post and Wired Magazine) and this talk will build on those themes, drawing parallels between the myriad stylistic facets of JavaScript and the kaleidescope of literary genres. There is a serious aspect - I hope to demonstrate that JavaScript's loose structure and lack of boilerplate encourages creativity and is something to celebrate rather than something to WTF about.\n\nOh, and as an added bonus I'll be unveiling an additional set of recently re-discovered works of literary JavaScript genius.\n","youtube_id":"j_EfPW4G-L0"},{"title":"JavaScript Journalism","url":"/talks/jsconf-us/2013/javascript-journalism.html","date":"2013-05-28 01:00:00 +0100","categories":["talks","jsconf-us","2013"],"body":"","description":"It is time that news stories told with JavaScript get recognized as a form of journalism.
