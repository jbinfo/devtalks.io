Very much like the \"Visible Ops Handbook,\" we are attempting to describe all the necessary and sufficient steps to create the culture, values, processes, procedures and daily work behind their transformations.\n\nWe describe what is required from each of the major stakeholders, including Development, Test, Product Management, as well as IT Operations.

It was difficult to integrate with internal systems, testing was often impractical, and it provided no isolation of configurations, among many other problems.

This allowed us to transfer knowledge among staff much more quickly. Pulling in and parameterizing application state - database contents, website assets, uploaded content - allowed us to spin up new environments with as much or as little state as needed. Integrating with Vagrant and Jenkins, we were then able to use chef to treat the entire image - system and application - as a test fixture.

The web has just begun it's foray into accommodating for DSP, becoming increasingly equipped to handle and modulate signals with the advent of technologies such as the Web Audio API and WebGL. With the basic DSP tools provided by these technologies, we are minimally bootstrapped and able to leverage these tools to implement powerful algorithms and incorporate powerful fields of research. One such application is the modulation and processing of music signals. In this talk I will focus on an application that is more complicated than it seems: automatic BPM detection of music. Due to the complexities of how we as humans perceive sound, parse harmonics, and \"feel\" beats within a song, BPM becomes a challenging and enthralling problem to tackle. I've just begun to embark on an endeavor to implement BPM detection in javascript, building upon budding DSP tools in JS and pulling from algorithms hardened by academic research. I have been digging into academic research papers in the field identifying and categorizing plausible algorithms from simple to complex, separated by effectiveness for differing applications. I hope to implement a number of these algorithms across this spectrum and compare their effectiveness for different kinds of music and applications. I believe exposing and providing robust algorithms for BPM detection would be a strong tool and asset towards many javascript-based web (and server-side ;D) applications, whether for categorization purposes, or for something more dynamic like music visualization.\n\nI first began my investigation into BPM detection as a way to break music visualization out of its frequency rut to reflect more compelling metrics such as BPM & key, which encode our consumption and perception of music in a different way. I plan to use my implementations to build out music visualizations that use alternative metrics in a compelling way that reflects (or invokes!) how we emotionally react to the music we listen to.\n","youtube_id":"XAqSLcNI9Ac"},{"title":"CreativeJS - making art in the browser","url":"/talks/jsconf-us/creativejs-making-art-in-the-browser.html","date":"2013-05-28 01:00:00 +0100","categories":["talks","jsconf-us"],"body":"","description":"Seb is known for his engaging presentations and this will be no exception.

In this talk, I'll highlight some of the more exciting prospects for science with LSST, and highlight how Python is being utilized within astronomy to encourage open, reproducible research as we process, analyze, and share our data.\n","youtube_id":"U51oPYSVU74"},{"title":"Visualizing Garbage Collection in Ruby and Python","url":"/talks/rupy/visualizing-garbage-collection-in-ruby-and-python.html","date":"2013-10-11 01:00:00 +0100","categories":["talks","rupy"],"body":"","description":"","youtube_id":"qzEekAnAS_g"},{"title":"What comes after REST","url":"/talks/rupy/what-comes-after-rest.html","date":"2013-10-11 01:00:00 +0100","categories":["talks","rupy"],"body":"","description":"","youtube_id":"ZQbM90m6CHI"},{"title":"What's new in the Symfony world","url":"/talks/symfony-live-berlin/fabien-potencier-whats-new-in-the-symfony-world.html","date":"2013-11-07 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfony-live-berlin"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"AgJ-9-Yz8nI"},{"title":"Performance Testing Checklist for Symfony2","url":"/talks/symfony-live-berlin/performance-testing-checklist-for-symfony2.html","date":"2013-11-07 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfony-live-berlin"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"b8ewqVGu77w"},{"title":"The Devops wonder","url":"/talks/symfony-live-berlin/the-devops-wonder.html","date":"2013-11-07 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfony-live-berlin"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"wz2kONQ8wmQ"},{"title":"Application monitoring with Heka and statsd","url":"/talks/symfonycon-warsaw/application-monitoring-with-heka-and-statsd.html","date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfonycon-warsaw"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"eV8U3YWrtr8"},{"title":"Build Awesome REST APIs With Symfony2","url":"/talks/symfonycon-warsaw/build-awesome-rest-apis-with-symfony2.html","date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfonycon-warsaw"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"AcLHvOT5Ekg"},{"title":"Community Building with Mentoring","url":"/talks/symfonycon-warsaw/community-building-with-mentoring.html","date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfonycon-warsaw"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"P7ht8mmbaWc"},{"title":"Cool like Frontend Developer: Grunt, RequireJS, Bower...","url":"/talks/symfonycon-warsaw/cool-like-frontend-developer-grunt-requirejs-bower.html","date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfonycon-warsaw"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"R7iN5SFglMo"},{"title":"Decouple your application ","url":"/talks/symfonycon-warsaw/decouple-your-application.html","date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfonycon-warsaw"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"K9jub4JPpcc"},{"title":"Fabien Potencier - Keynote","url":"/talks/symfonycon-warsaw/fabien-potencier-keynote.html","date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfonycon-warsaw"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"qlrwfOL0230"},{"title":"How Kris Writes Symfony Apps","url":"/talks/symfonycon-warsaw/how-kris-writes-symfony-apps.html","date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","symfonycon-warsaw"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"Pn2lYHvnoUQ"},{"title":"Delivering the goods","url":"/talks/oreilly-media-fluent/delivering-the-goods.html","date":"2014-03-11 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","oreilly-media-fluent"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"R8W_6xWphtw"},{"title":"JavaScript Taking Both the High and Low Roads","url":"/talks/oreilly-media-fluent/javascript-taking-both-the-high-and-low-roads.html","date":"2014-03-11 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","oreilly-media-fluent"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"aZqhRICne_M"},{"title":"The Humble Border-Radius","url":"/talks/oreilly-media-fluent/the-humble-border-radius.html","date":"2014-03-11 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","oreilly-media-fluent"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"JSaMl2OKjfQ"},{"title":"Virtual Machines, JavaScript and Assembler","url":"/talks/oreilly-media-fluent/virtual-machines-javascript-and-assembler.html","date":"2014-03-11 00:00:00 +0000","categories":["talks","oreilly-media-fluent"],"body":"","description":null,"youtube_id":"UzyoT4DziQ4"},{"title":"0 to 00111100 with web2py","url":"/talks/pycon/0-to-00111100-with-web2py.html","date":"2014-04-09 01:00:00 +0100","categories":["talks","pycon"],"body":"","description":"This tutorial teaches basic web development for people who have some experience with HTML.

I'm particularly going to focus on helping you decide when it's appropriate to use each customization type and also whether or not you should customize - it would be a fallacy for me to tell you that just because you can customize something, you automatically should.

Driving devops can make you feel a little like the whale!\n\nPassion, drive and relentless pursuit of almost mythical productivity improvements while ignoring the organizational necessities of building adoption and showing incremental successes early can make devops evangelists appear to be crazed Captain Ahabs. As your teams lash themselves to the mast waiting for the inevitable confrontation with an organization that 'has always done things this way..' you bellow into the gale...'cant you see that this is so much better!!'\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way. Large enterprises, like GE Capital, have a great deal to both learn and teach about implementing devops at scale. Moby Dick is one of the greatest american novels ever written and is a brilliant analogy for what to avoid if your aim is to tame the devops whale in enterprises where you do not control all the elements. The big sea is very different from a garage...\n\nFrom this cautionary tale, we learn;\n\nThe importance of committing - don't just talk about devops. Do it. Decide to go to sea.\nBuilding a diverse willing team from across your business. Secret stowaway projects deliver early and then stall.\nListen to the advice of other captains. There will be problems along the way and you will need them on the way back for sure.\nDe-Centre your excellence. Its easier to land the whale with a lot of little boats than one big one.\nDevops changes the very fabric of how large enterprises have evolved to deliver IT systems...and yet you will find your message has enormous resonance for many. The secret to effectively seeding devops and growing its influence in your organization lies with the organization itself and how you make your devops journey everyone else's too.\n","youtube_id":"ZEwoHx5FC4E"},{"title":"IBM DevOps For Cloud Delivers Smarter Apps","url":"/talks/chefconf-san-francisco/ibm-devops-for-cloud-delivers-smarter-apps.html","date":"2014-04-15 01:00:00 +0100","categories":["talks","chefconf-san-francisco"],"body":"","description":"","youtube_id":"FupjKKKCvww"},{"title":"Implementing Continuous Delivery In Chef","url":"/talks/chefconf-san-francisco/implementing-continuous-delivery-in-chef.html","date":"2014-04-15 01:00:00 +0100","categories":["talks","chefconf-san-francisco"],"body":"","description":"","youtube_id":"SjKDXJbjLT0"},{"title":"Kanban will save You...!

Patience and persistence will be needed for leaders tasked with driving change while maintaining profitability. Successful leaders must also balance existing corporate success against the opportunity to improve. Pursuing new ideas always comes with the risk of failure, but failing to continuously improve will also lead to quickly losing market share in a very competitive market. For many large organizations, better IT automation offers a great way to enable innovative risk-taking through cost reduction and faster delivery.\n\nThis talk is a summary of my experiences championing better infrastructure service delivery through automation.
